pusher
=================

When you need more interactivity in your web-applications, you think about real-time messaging.
One of the possible solution is to use a standalone [Comet](http://goo.gl/Gf0J) server.
This allows a web server to push data to a browser, without the browser explicitly requesting it.

Pusher allows you to build awesome live web-applications.
It works as a standalone server via HTTP protocol, builds on [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [socket.io](http://socket.io/).
You could use PHP, Ruby, Java or something else and easily deliver the notification messages to the clients browsers.
This comet server provides a simple way to deliver messages to a specific user, group of users or special channels.
Receiving messages in the browser is as simple as connecting to the push server and subscribing to topics or channels.
